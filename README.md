## Requirements
- Matlab R2015a
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- R (for calibrating base EC statistics)

## Style and content images used in the paper:
### Style Images
50 style images presented in the paper are collected from previous work and online sources. 
Download from the [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6mrsdo12s459nm/50styles.zip?dl=0])

See 50 styles from the following links:
[50styles_1.pdf](https://github.com/stringtron/quantative_style/files/4075093/50styles_1.pdf) 
[50styles_2.pdf](https://github.com/stringtron/quantative_style/files/4075094/50styles_2.pdf)


### Content Images 
We use 200 test images and their ground truth contour annotations from the [BSDS500 dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html).
Download all test content images, annotations, and style transferred images used in the paper from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qb8mwnqclwaotgv/BSDS500.zip?dl=0).
Unzip downloaded file and put all subfolders under "./BSDS500" in this repo.

## Experiment procedure
For each configuration of one style transfer method, we randomly sample 300 combination of "style loss weight"-"content ID" -"style ID" and generate their corresponding style transfer images. These images are used for the following quantitative evaluation of style transfer methods.

### Base C statistics 
We use an off-the-shelf contour detection method by Arbelaezet al. [1],which estimates the probabiliy of boundaries (Pb) given an image.

The following example evaluate images generated from Universal Style transfer method: 
1. open Matlab and change directory to `./wacv2020testscript`
2. run `evaluation_streamline.m`, this will generate Pb maps and evaluation results from 300 style transfer images generated with Universal Style Transfer.
3. retreive evaluation results from `./BSDS500/ucm2/SampleTests/Universal` folder.

Breakdown Pb evaluation results for base C statistics:
1. Each folder in `./BSDS500/ucm2/SampleTests` represents evaluations on a set style transfer images generated by one configuration of a style transfer method.
2. Take Universal Style Transfer for example,
  - `PbRsts` stores every style transfer images' Pb detection result as a `.mat` file.
  - `round1_eval` stores Pb precision recall curves for evaluated images, see column names in this [function](https://github.com/stringtron/quantative_style/blob/master/bench/benchmarks/evaluation_bdry_image.m) for details.
  - `round1_eval_sum` summarizes Pb evaluation results by style loss weights, `all` folder includes all 300 images.
      - `eval_bdry.txt`,`eval_bdry_img.txt`, `eval_bdry_thr.txt` stores intermediate results
      - `Universal_everyImgAUC.mat` stores base C statistics for all evaluated style transfer images. Each row shows weight, content and style ids, and the base C statistics for one image. This repo reports Pb precision-recall curve AUC as base C statistics, the max F-1 scores which is the final reported score in our paper, can also be generated using this codebase, see this [function](https://github.com/stringtron/quantative_style/blob/master/bench/benchmarks/collect_eval_bdry.m) for details. 



### Evaluation of base E statistics

```
python E_base.ipynb
```


We calculate the minus log KL distance between feature statistics of symthesized image and style image. For the evaluation of KL distance, We also use the PCA to reduce the rank of feature channels. Please see our paper for the details.
